## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1️⃣ **Registration & Login:** Secure signup and login processes using PHP sessions, with server-side validation ensuring data integrity.  
2️⃣ **Profile Management:** Users can securely update their info and access a personalized dashboard.  
3️⃣ **Inquiry Submission:** Validated contact form posting data reliably to backend with error handling.  
4️⃣ **Session & Access Control:** Protected pages require authentication, with logout properly invalidating sessions to prevent unauthorized access.  
5️⃣ **Performance Tested:** API endpoints stress-tested up to 50 concurrent users and 1,200 requests, maintaining sub-second response times.  
6️⃣ **AWS Infrastructure:** Hosted on EC2 with scalable RDS backend, ensuring high availability.
